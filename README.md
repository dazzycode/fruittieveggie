 Welcome to Zillion art. I’m an artist based in the lagos. My passion lies in painting flowers and emotional images of recent occasions and Description of the prophets Hadith’s into canvas capturing beauty. I find inspiration in the intricate beauty of Islamic architecture.

For me, painting is more than a profession—it’s a form of expression and a way to connect deeply with my audience. I pour my heart into each piece, aiming to evoke a profound emotional response from those who view or acquire my art. I aspire for my work to be both inspiring and cherished, resonating with the beauty it represents. 
My preferred mediums are acrylic paints and inks, which allow me to bring detail to my work. I often enhance my paintings with gold leaf, adding a luxurious touch that reflects the rich heritage of Islamic architecture.
